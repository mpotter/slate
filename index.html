<p>This document is the source of truth for critical consistencies in our product
development process.</p>

<p>The goal of this document is to establish ownership and accountability for
every individual involved in building our products by clarifying their
responsibilities and establishing expectations <em>between</em> roles. By focusing on
what&rsquo;s expected of you from other members of your project team at various
stages of our process, our goal is to get out of the way of you doing your best
work while putting you in a position to support your peers to do the same.</p>

<p>Products are not built by individuals; Products are built by teams. Here is
how our team works together.</p>

<h1 id="planning">Planning</h1>

<pre class="highlight markdown Producer">
  <p>During Planning, your principal focus will be on identifying and
  communicating requirements. On Partner projects, this will primarily involve interviewing Partners to understand their needs.</p>

  <p>You will communicate the requirements and constraints that you identify
  from stakeholders to the Product Designer and Product Engineer in order for
  them to consider appropriate solutions.</p>

<p>The goal of Planning is to translate assumptions about how a problem or set of
problems can be solved by a product into requirements for software development.</p>

<p>The process is successful when members of the Planning team spend less than 20%
of their time on the project in Production.</p>

<p>The risks to success in this process:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Planning team isn&rsquo;t thorough enough in specifying requirements and they
end up spending more than 20% of their time focused on this project in
Production clarifying requirements.</li>
<li>The Planning team spends more time specifying and conditioning requirements
for a release than they would if they just designed and coded everything
themselves.</li>
</ul>

<p>This section attempts to provide the Planning team with a framework for
achieving the goal while addressing those risks.</p>

<h2 id="document-problems">Document problems</h2>

<p>We believe a product release should organize around a clear understanding of
what problems it&rsquo;s trying to address. Write down what problems you&rsquo;re solving
and, if helpful, which ones you&rsquo;re acknowledging but choosing <em>not</em> to solve.
This will make future debate and discussion of scope and functionality much
more efficient because criticism can occur on the merit of a feature&rsquo;s ability
to solve a particular problem, not their general merit (which is much harder
and subjective).</p>

<p>Problem statements should be easily understood not just by the Planning team,
but every contributor to the product, including potential future contributors.
It&rsquo;s usually easier to understand problems that are organized <em>discreetly</em> and
without too much dependency knowledge or overlap. Now is also a good time to
define any domain-specific language that you&rsquo;re running into since it&rsquo;ll be
fresh in your mind.</p>

<p>Recall that the primary purpose of your problem statements is for them to be
useful in prioritizing and iterating on functionality so, if you have important functionality in mind, work back to understand why you think it&rsquo;s important and
what problem it&rsquo;s solving.</p>

<p>Lastly, it&rsquo;s not always true that you will <em>only</em> be solving problems that the
end-user of the product has. In some cases, the needs of a Partner, a sales
organization, or other stakeholders should be considered in the problem set as
well, if not as a principal concern.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Any product feature that is required to address a problem you&rsquo;ve identified
is a <em>critical</em> assumption. Another way to think about what is a &ldquo;critical&rdquo;
assumption vs. a &ldquo;table stakes&rdquo; feature is that critical assumptions are what
makes the product uniquely valuable. Table stakes features, on the other hand,
<em>need</em> to exist as to not detract from the effectiveness of the critical
assumptions.</p></li>
<li><p>We separate &ldquo;critical&rdquo; assumptions from &ldquo;table stakes&rdquo; features to help
ensure the Planning team spends 80% of their time in Planning on the &ldquo;critical&rdquo;
features. They should only spend 20% of their time making sure table stakes
functionality is captured.</p></li>
<li><p>Document <em>all</em> critical assumptions within the UX Prototype. Describe any
ambiguity that can&rsquo;t be adequately documented in the UX Prototype in the
README.</p></li>
<li><p>You should identify metrics behind all of these features. The metrics you
identify should be monitored because they relate or contribute to the KPIs.</p></li>
<li><p>These assumptions should inherently put forward a hypothesis as to how the
problems are going to be solved. The UX (and in some cases UI) of how they&rsquo;re
implemented and tested is critical to the release’s success. You should take
care to document what this hypothesis or hypotheses are in the release&rsquo;s README
for your own benefit and for the benefit of future team members.</p></li>
<li><p>You should have as few of these as necessary to solving the problems you’ve
outlined. If there are assumptions that overlap, attempt to prioritize one of
the assumptions and push the others to a future release.</p></li>
<li><p>Solutions that compete or overlap should be prioritized in descending order
of their assumed impact in addressing the problem(s) divided by their estimated
complexity multiplied by their estimated cost: (impact) / (complexity * cost).</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>Any product feature whose implementation doesn&rsquo;t directly affect a problem
you&rsquo;ve identified is a <em>table stakes</em> feature. Said differently, if the feature
just needs &ldquo;to exist&rdquo; but, the details for how it&rsquo;s implemented (assuming
general best practices are met) don&rsquo;t have an impact on how successfully the
problems are addressed.</p></li>
<li><p>Document <em>all</em> table stakes features within the UX Prototype. Describe any
ambiguity that can&rsquo;t be adequately documented in the UX Prototype in the README.</p></li>
<li><p>These assumptions have minimal impact on directly solving the problems but
are important to either meet market expectations or otherwise avoid impacting
the effectiveness of the critical assumptions. They need to exist but the UX/UI
of how they’re implemented is not seen as a meaningful risk to testing the
assumptions.</p></li>
<li><p>You should invest as least as possible in these assumptions. You should work

<ul>
<li><p>A &ldquo;user path&rdquo; is a complete thought for something the user is able to
accomplish in the product.</p></li>
<li><p> How user paths are best broken up is somewhat subjective. We believe the
most useful delineation considers the needed collaboration between all
stakeholders. Our best governing thought to this end is to consider paths from
the perspective of what a user is trying to accomplish with a feature or set of
features. We think this is the easiest framing for everyone to understand.</p></li>
<li><p>If you find that you&rsquo;ve created a path that, once implemented, is only
partially useful for the end user to accomplish something, the path might be
too small and/or should be combined with paths that unlock the entire
functionality that the user would need to accomplish the intended outcome. If
instead you can consider useful features within a path that are discretely
valuable to the user, the path is perhaps too broad or long.</p></li>
<li><p>Paths should be one sentence and phrased as actions the user takes to
accomplish an objective. Please use sentence case for consistency.</p></li>
<li><p>Once you&rsquo;ve settled on what all the paths are (or, have a good first draft),
traverse the path from the perspective of the end-user from every possible
entry point and precondition and take every possible action. Each precondition
and entry point, combined with the branch formed by a sequence of actions form
the &ldquo;scenarios&rdquo; within the path.</p></li>
<li><p>Your goal in identifying scenarios is to articulate all the <em>boundary</em> cases
for a path. Boundary cases are useful in specifying how the product should
behave when one of its inputs is at or just beyond its maximum or minimum
limits. By discovering and documenting all boundary cases within a feature, you
will have simulated the stress a user will eventually bring the product,
surfaced any needed clarification before software is written, and established
the outline for all the subsequent acceptance tests to be written.</p></li>
<li><p>To help generate scenarios and potentially boundary cases, consider the &ldquo;best
practices&rdquo; list we provide and include e.g. error state considerations, etc.</p></li>

quality software to be created with higher concurrency in Production.</p>

<p>The process is successful when more team members are introduced in Production

<li>The Pre-production team doesn&rsquo;t just focus on Prereqs and spends more time
than they need to before starting production.</li>

Prereqs.</li>

more costly to develop and maintain.</li>
