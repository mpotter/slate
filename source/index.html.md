# Introduction

<pre class="highlight Producer">
  <p>Hello Producer!</p>

  <p>Your focus is on communicating effectively with internal and external
  stakeholders. You reduce the risk of our work connecting effectively to
  the priorities of external Partners. You lower the cost of communication
  for our builders within the organization by normalizing and providing
  an easy conduit for requirements.</p>

# Planning

<pre class="highlight markdown Producer">
  <p>During Planning, your principal focus will be on identifying and
  communicating requirements. On Partner projects, this will primarily involve interviewing Partners to understand their needs.</p>

  <p>You will communicate the requirements and constraints that you identify
  from stakeholders to the Product Designer and Product Engineer in order for
  them to consider appropriate solutions.</p>

The goal of Planning is to translate assumptions about how a problem or set of
problems can be solved by a product into requirements for software development.

The process is successful when members of the Planning team spend less than 20%
of their time on the project in Production.

The risks to success in this process:

- The Planning team isn't thorough enough in specifying requirements and they
end up spending more than 20% of their time focused on this project in
Production.
- The Planning team spends more time specifying and conditioning requirements
for a release than they would if they participated in Production.

## Document problems

<pre class="highlight Producer">
  <p>Ensure that the problem statements reflect your understanding of the
  feedback and input that's been provided by all stakeholders. Play the role
  of the stakeholder when they're not in the room.</p>

-  A release must be focused on a discrete set of problems you're intending to address. Work hard to ensure the problem statements are phrased in such a way that they don't have too much overlap, useful in prioritizing features, and measurable.

- It's not always true that you will only be solving problems that the end-user of the product has. In some cases, the needs of a Partner, a sales organization, or other stakeholders should be considered in the problem set as well, if not as a principal concern.

## Document KPIs

<pre class="highlight Producer">
  <p>You will be responsible for creating alignment around the effectiveness
  by which the KPIs represent success for the project. Essentially, these
  KPIs will form a scoreboard. So, whatever each of the stakeholders whose
  interests you represent consider success should be captured here.</p>

- We call the metrics you use to measure your success in addressing the
problems "Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)." A problem might have one or more
metrics.

- KPIs should settle debates on scope. One should be able to use the KPIs to
argue in favor or against scope on the basis of its impact on the KPIs.

- Store all the problems and KPIs in a Google Doc titled "README" that's easily
discovered by all future team members. Work hard to ensure that the document is
useful to all future team members, particularly ones who may not have developed
extensive domain knowledge in the product's market.

## Document critical assumptions

<pre class="highlight Producer">
  <p>Make sure you understand how the assumptions relate to the problems that
  the team is trying to solve. If this were your startup, and the stakeholders
  are your potential investors, you should be able to construct a flawless
  pitch for the features the team has come up with.</p>

- Any product feature that is required to address a problem you've identified
is a *critical* assumption. Another way to think about what is a "critical"
assumption vs. a "table stakes" feature is that critical assumptions are what
makes the product uniquely valuable. Table stakes features, on the other hand,
_need_ to exist as to not detract from the effectiveness of the critical
assumptions.

- We separate "critical" assumptions from "table stakes" features to help
ensure the Planning team spends 80% of their time in Planning on the "critical"
features. They should only spend 20% of their time making sure table stakes
functionality is captured.

- Document _all_ critical assumptions within the UX Prototype. Describe any
ambiguity that can't be adequately documented in the UX Prototype in the
README.

- You should identify metrics behind all of these features. The metrics you
identify should be monitored because they relate or contribute to the KPIs.

- These assumptions should inherently put forward a hypothesis as to how the
problems are going to be solved. The UX (and in some cases UI) of how they're
implemented and tested is critical to the release’s success. You should take
care to document what this hypothesis or hypotheses are in the release's README
for your own benefit and for the benefit of future team members.

- You should have as few of these as necessary to solving the problems you’ve
outlined. If there are assumptions that overlap, attempt to prioritize one of
the assumptions and push the others to a future release.

- Solutions that compete or overlap should be prioritized in descending order
of their assumed impact in addressing the problem(s) divided by their estimated
complexity multiplied by their estimated cost: (impact) / (complexity * cost).

### Examples

- "Results from acceptance test runs should be posted to GitHub for successful
integration with a software engineer's workflow" (from Fino)

## Document table stakes features

<pre class="highlight Producer">
  <p>Ensure that the features identified here encompass any concern for
  functionality that the stakeholders have expressed. If you think a feature
  listed here _is_ critical from the stakeholders perspective, be sure to
  express that argument to the team to ensure they're considering the degree
  of its importance properly.</p>

- Any product feature whose implementation doesn't directly affect a problem
you've identified is a *table stakes* feature. Said differently, if the feature
just needs "to exist" but, the details for how it's implemented (assuming
general best practices are met) don't have an impact on how successfully the
problems are addressed.

- Document _all_ table stakes features within the UX Prototype. Describe any
ambiguity that can't be adequately documented in the UX Prototype in the README.

- These assumptions have minimal impact on directly solving the problems but
are important to either meet market expectations or otherwise avoid impacting
the effectiveness of the critical assumptions. They need to exist but the UX/UI
of how they’re implemented is not seen as a meaningful risk to testing the
assumptions.

- You should invest as least as possible in these assumptions. You should work
hard to reduce scope. The solutions should have a strong bias to using
pre-existing patterns.

### Examples

- "A user needs to be able to recover their account if they forget their
password" (from Fino)

- A "user path" is a complete thought for something the user is able to
accomplish in the product.

-  How user paths are best broken up is somewhat subjective. We believe the
most useful delineation considers the needed collaboration between all
stakeholders. Our best governing thought to this end is to consider paths from
the perspective of what a user is trying to accomplish with a feature or set of
features. We think this is the easiest framing for everyone to understand.

- If you find that you've created a path that, once implemented, is only
partially useful for the end user to accomplish something, the path might be
too small and/or should be combined with paths that unlock the entire
functionality that the user would need to accomplish the intended outcome. If
instead you can consider useful features within a path that are discretely
valuable to the user, the path is perhaps too broad or long.

- Paths should be one sentence and phrased as actions the user takes to
accomplish an objective. Please use sentence case for consistency.

- Once you've settled on what all the paths are (or, have a good first draft),
traverse the path from the perspective of the end-user from every possible
entry point and precondition and take every possible action. Each precondition
and entry point, combined with the branch formed by a sequence of actions form
the "scenarios" within the path.

- Your goal in identifying scenarios is to articulate all the _boundary_ cases
for a path. Boundary cases are useful in specifying how the product should
behave when one of its inputs is at or just beyond its maximum or minimum
limits. By discovering and documenting all boundary cases within a feature, you
will have simulated the stress a user will eventually bring the product,
surfaced any needed clarification before software is written, and established
the outline for all the subsequent acceptance tests to be written.

- To help generate scenarios and potentially boundary cases, consider the "best
practices" list we provide and include e.g. error state considerations, etc.

- Prereqs are units of work that are specifically called out as opportunities
to operate with higher concurrency in Production.

- Ask "what tasks can and should be done by one or few individuals first that,
once completed, would mean the team could double in size and grow more
productive?"

- e.g. "Setup staging environment," "Set up CircleCI to run specs", "Document
use of React and Redux", etc.

- Consider the "best practices" list we provide and include e.g. developer
operations tasks, establishing stack design patterns, etc.

- A "topic" should be composed of work within an area of the application that
should, for efficiency’s sake, be completed by a specific engineer and/or in a
specific sequence, i.e. Jane is the best person to develop this feature because
she has or will develop that other feature.

- Topics should be as small as possible to encourage higher concurrency and
fewer dependencies. A topic is too big if a subset of its tasks can be
completed efficiently by two different engineers with the same skill-set. A
topic is too small if it excludes related functionality that, for efficiency's
sake, is best completed by that same engineer.

- These will serve as placeholder units for requirements to be documented
within. For now, they're just high-level user flows with scenario titles and
prereqs. We create them now so that they can be flushed out as the project
progresses to contain all requirements for software development (Scenarios,
UI Flow, Acceptance Tests, Planning Estimate, Subtasks, Implementation Notes).

- When creating them, use a label system to delineate which issues have all the
requirements necessary to begin software development and which do not, e.g
`needs UI`, `needs acceptance test`, `needs planning estimate`.

- Create the estimate by considering the sum complexity of all the scenarios
within the path.

- Use person-hours and consider the full-stack.

- For any estimate that is longer than 4 hours, break the path out into
subtasks and ensure each isn't estimated to take longer than 4 person-hours.
Total the estimate for each of the subtasks to generate the Planning Estimate
for the entire path. Document all subtasks and any assumptions you have about
the implementation within the GitHub issue under sections called "Subtasks" and
"Implementation Notes" respectively.

- The end result will produce a staffing plan and timeline.

- Contributor tracks should dictate sequence in which work is completed and
reflect intra and inter topic efficiencies.

- By definition, all prereqs should come first, globally.

- Make note of which paths need to be completed in Pre-production. A completed
path requires an acceptance test and a UI flow for all scenarios. The goal is
to maintain a greater than one week buffer between completed requirements for
user paths (Scenarios, UI Flow, Acceptance Tests, Planning Estimate, Subtasks,
Implementation Notes) and software development.

- Use GitHub Milestones and GitHub Projects to document the intra and inter
topic Issue sequence.

The goal of Pre-production is to complete tasks that will allow for higher
quality software to be created with higher concurrency in Production.

The process is successful when more team members are introduced in Production
in a manner that doesn't compromise efficiency or software quality.

The risks to success in this process:

- The Pre-production team doesn't just focus on Prereqs and spends more time
than they need to before starting production.
- Production is staffed too early and team members end up blocked by missing
Prereqs.
- Code patterns are missing causing the code base to grow inconsistent and
more costly to develop and maintain.

- Code should meet AbleCop expectations.

- PRs eligible for QA should include both front-end and back-end.

- PRs should include Planter seed file.

- Communicate what you're working on.

- After you familiarize yourself with the work, add a Production Estimate to
the Issue to let your team know when to expect your work to be completed and
escalate risk. We may eventually use a custom solution like Tracks to escalate
estimation risk and reinforce expectations for team communication.

- Write the code to address the user flow (GitHub Issue) on *one branch.*  If
you are intending to collaborate across areas of the stack (i.e. front-end and
back-end), coordinate or pair with the other engineer and use the same branch.

- PRs should target the `stable` branch.
